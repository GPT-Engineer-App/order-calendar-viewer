# order-calendar-viewer

A cross-platform application for Windows and Android that runs in the browser and uses Firestore as a cloud data server. The application will be built with Vue or Python and will be used for checking order information. Features include: 1. Displaying a calendar on the homepage that shows up to one month ahead. 2. Clicking on a date in the calendar to display the order data for that date on a separate page. 3. Allowing manual input of order data for specific dates through the browser.
